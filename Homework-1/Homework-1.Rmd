## **2) Wrangling the Billboard Top 100** 
The weekly Billboard Top 100 list has tracked the most popular songs and artists in the U.S. since 1958, compiling data points from radio airplays, audio sales, and streaming activity.

*Caption:* Imagine Dragons' "Radioactive" is the most popular song with 87 total appearances on the Billboard Top 100 since its release in 2012, followed by AWOLNATION's 2011 hit "Sail" with a total of 79 weekly appearances. Jason Mraz's "I'm Yours", released in 2008, and The Weeknd's "Blinding Lights, recently released in 2020, tied for third place with 76 weekly appearances each.

### **Part B**
Th musical diversity of the Billboard 100 has increased over the few last decades, last peaking in 1966 when 832 unique songs appeared on the list. Diversity then dropped into the early 2000's before rising again to reach 804 distinct appearances on the Billboard 100 in 2020.

### **Part C**
There have been 19 artists who have had at least 30 songs appear on the Billboard Top 100 more than ten times since 1958. As of 2021, leading the lineup is Elton John with 52 songs followed by Madonna with 44 and Kenny Chesney with 42.

## **3) Wrangling the Olympics**

### **Part A**
The 95th percentile of female Olympic medalists in the top 20 sports between 1924 and 2016 is 186 cm.   

|                    	| **95th Percentile** 	|
|--------------------	|---------------------	|
| Female Height (cm) 	| 186.0               	|

```{r olympics_a, echo=FALSE}
olympics_female = read_csv(here("data/olympics_clean.csv"), show_col_types = FALSE) %>%

  filter(sex=="F") %>%
  group_by(event)
perc95 = quantile(olympics_female$height, 0.95)
attach(olympics_female)
```

### **Part B** 
The greatest variation in female medalists' height occurs in Women's Coxed Fours Rowing, where the average height is 173.3 cm with a standard deviation of 10.9 cm. Overall, Coxed Rowing events account for three out of the top five for most varied height distributions - this is due to the historically dramatic difference in optimal heights for crew rowers versus coxswains. 

|                                       	| **Average Height (cm)** 	| **Standard Deviation (cm)** 	|

```

### **Part C**
Looking at the average ages of Olympic swimmers over time, we observe that overall average age peaked in 1920 before falling until the 1976 Olympics. Since 1976, average age has steadily grown to reach 23.2 in 2016.

## **4) K-nearest neighbors**
The 350 trim level yields a higher optimal value of k, equal to 32. This may be due to the fact that there is less variance in the data for 350 trim models than for 65 AMG models. Thus, the 350 KNN model can optimize with a higher value of k (more neighbors, but lower sd) to minimize error as compared to the KNN model for the 65 AMG cars.    
```{r sclass, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, message=FALSE}
